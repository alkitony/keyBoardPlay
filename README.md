**Description:**

This site is a variation of the patatap.com site. Both sites utilize paperjs for graphics and animation and howler.js for sound play. The Key Board Play site was an exercise from the Web Developer Bootcamp class.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of the exercise was to become familiar with utilizing a graphical and sound library.  For simplicity sake the css style and JS script is contained within the html file. This can be separated out into their respective files. However, since the bulk of the effort is JS, it made sense to keep it in one file.

## Coding Highlights ##
1. OOP: The initial exercise had hard coded an object for each letter, which contained a sound and color. Based on lessons on OOP, I created a constructor function and programmatically created 26 objects.
